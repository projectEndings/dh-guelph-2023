## Morning: Release Management – Sharing Your Data and Planning to Share Your Project

* Releases

    * How will you know that you are done?
    * What is a release? Why does it matter (there is no such thing as a document)

* The Sense of an Ending. Multiple endpoints (milestones).
* What if I get hit by a bus?
* When is your next release?
    * What needs to be done for that release?
    * How will you measure progress towards the release?

## Afternoon: Archiving – Saving Your Data

* Archiving data versus archiving projects
* Glossary of repositories / terms you might hear:
    * Institutional repository / dataverse
    * What are the weaknesses and strengths of your project?
    * What dependencies do you have that you can eliminate?
    * What’s your short-term host?
    * What’s your long-term archival host?
